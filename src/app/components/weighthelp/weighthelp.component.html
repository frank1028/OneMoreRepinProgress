              <br/><br> For Set 1 use a weight you think you can do 10 reps with, but do more or less stopping when the rep is just a little difficult.
              <br /><br />Enter this weight and reps into Set 1.
              <br /><br /> Then use the available weight closest to the "You are capable of ..." weight in the next sets. Example: for 25.58 use 25
              <br /><br /><strong>IF YOU CHANGED YOUR GOAL:</strong>
              <br /><br />Ignore :"Add Weight", "Next Set Goal", and "You are capable of..." until after you complete the following:
              <br /><br />Re-enter the weight and reps from Set 1 Latest  (don't actually do the weight and reps).
              <br /><br /> Then use the available weight closest to the "You are capable of ..." weight in all sets starting with Set 1. Example: for 49.39 use 50
